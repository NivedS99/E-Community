## 📖 Project Overview

In most residential areas, keeping track of house-to-resident data, handling service-related issues, and addressing emergency needs can become complex and time-consuming.

This system allows:
- Committee members to manage resident records
- Residents to report issues (electricity, plumbing, water, etc.)
- Access to emergency contact details
- Submitting queries, complaints, and suggestions directly to the admin

It is designed to be a **global** and **scalable** solution that can be adopted by any residential community looking to digitize and streamline their internal operations.
